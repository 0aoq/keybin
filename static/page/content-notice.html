				Content (Known as "Bins")<sup>[1]</sup> uploaded and managed on Keybin and any Keybin
				instance are <un>not</un> created or maintained by
				<a href="https://github.com/0aoq/keybin">Keybin</a>, or any Keybin contributor or client
				host.<br /><br />

				A Keybin "<un>Client host</un>" is an individual or organization that hosts the Keybin
				client.<sup>[2]</sup> Keybin is open-source, therefore any hosted client accessible to
				internet users could have been modified or might not enforce required policies.<br /><br />

				A "Bin" uploaded to Keybin can be of two types: a <un>normal bin</un><sup>[1]</sup> which
				allows users to manage text and code blocks, and an <un>HTML bin</un><sup>[1]</sup>. HTML
				bins allow users to create fully custom HTML pages and share them with other users through
				Keybin. These HTML pages can be used by untrustworthy actors to leverage the Keybin service to trick
				users into downloading malicious files or submitting personal information.<br /><br />

				Keybin is not responsible for the content found on a Keybin bin or HTML bin. <!-- Bins can be
				reported to the
				<un>client host</un><sup>[2]</sup> this message is being viewed on by clicking
				<a href="/bin/report">here</a>. -->
